Contributions are welcome.

For small/trivial changes, feel free to open a pull request. For larger changes
or changes that require design decisions (if there are no obviously best way to
do the change, or there are significantly different possibilities of
implementation) please open an issue first for discussion.

To find things that need doing, take a look at our
[issues](https://github.com/yds12/tarsila/issues), specially the ones marked
with
[help wanted](https://github.com/yds12/tarsila/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

For general discussions, feature brainstorming, etc. visit our
